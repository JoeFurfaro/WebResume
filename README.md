# CS 1XA3 Project02 - furfaroj
## Overview
This website is a online public copy of Joe Furfaro's resume. It is written in HTML, JavaScript (using jQuery), and CSS (using Bootstrap 4) for a project in the course COMPSCI 1XA3 at McMaster. The purpose of this project is to be evaluated on my front-end web development abilities.

This website can either be accessed through [the course web site](http://mac1xa3.ca/u/furfaroj) or [my own website](http://joefurfaro.ca).

## Custom JavaScript Features
#### Dark Mode / Light Mode
Press the Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle button at the top of the screen to change the website color theme. Dark mode decreases brightness of all elements, including images.

#### Evil Mode
Click Joe's picture to toggle on and off evil mode. Each time evil mode is enabled, a random evil feature will be toggled on. See if you can spot all 6 possible evil features!
